"""This module contains the logic for the subscription mechanism.

Subscriptions are implemented through the capnp stream mechanism. This handles
all the communication stuff, e.g. back pressure and flow control. The only thing
the client needs to provide is a `SessionClient.StreamingHandle.Server`
implementation. The `sendValues()` method of this class will be called by the
kernel through RPC whenever an update event for the subscribed node is
received. To make this as simple as possible the user only interacts with
a DataQueue object. A async queue with the addition of a connection guard.

It is possible to create a fork of a data queue. A fork will receive the
values from the same underlying subscription as the original data queue.
However, the connection state of the fork is independent of the original.

It is always recommended to disconnect the data queue when it is not needed
anymore. This will free up resources on the server side and prevent the server
from sending unnecessary data.
