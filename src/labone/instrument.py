    """Generic driver for a Zurich Instrument device.

    This class serves as the main entry point for any connection to a
    Zurich Instrument device.

    At Zurich Instruments a server-based connectivity methodology is used.
    Server-based means that all communication between the user and the
    instrument takes place via a computer program called a server, the data
    server. (For more information on the architecture please refer to the
    [user manual](http://docs.zhinst.com/labone_programming_manual/introduction.html))

    !!! note

        Due to the asynchronous interface, one needs to use the static method
        `create` instead of the `__init__` method.

            The serial number can be found on the back panel of the instrument.
