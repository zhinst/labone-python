        Note:
            A node can be subscribed multiple times. Each subscription will
            create a new queue. The queues are independent of each other. It is
            however recommended to only subscribe to a node once and then fork
            the queue into multiple independent queues if needed. This will

            There is no explicit unsubscribe function. The subscription will
